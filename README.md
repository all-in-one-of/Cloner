**Cloner** is an example of use of the [procedural instancing] feature that
was newly introduced in Unity 5.6.

*Cloner* creates instances of a given template mesh and place them onto
vertices of a given base model. It uses a [compute shader] for vertex
animation and [GPU instancing] for duplicating the template model. With helps
of these GPU features, it can draw complex animation without spending much
CPU time.

System Requirements
-------------------

- Unity 5.6 or later

*Cloner* only runs on the platforms that support compute shaders and GPU
instancing.
